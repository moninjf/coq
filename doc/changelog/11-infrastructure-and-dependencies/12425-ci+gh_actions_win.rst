- **Changed:**
  Coq's continuous integration now provides a more accessible Windows
  installer artifact in the "Checks" GitHub tab, both for pull
  requests and the `master` branch.

  This facilitates testing Coq's bleeding edge builds on Windows, and
  should be more reliable than the previous setup (`#12425
  <https://github.com/coq/coq/pull/12425>`_, by Emilio Jesus Gallego
  Arias).
